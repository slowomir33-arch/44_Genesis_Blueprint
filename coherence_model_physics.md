## Abstract

We propose that coherence — the degree of internal phase-synchronization of any information-processing system — satisfies the formal criteria for a universal measure of truth. We show this quantity is mathematically identical across signal processing, thermodynamics, neuroscience, and decision theory. No metaphysical assumptions are required. The framework generates testable predictions.

## 1. Definitions

**Coherence (C):** Normalized measure of internal synchronization.

```
C = 1 - H(S)/H_max
```

Where H(S) is Shannon entropy of system S, and H_max is maximum possible entropy for that system.

- C = 1: perfectly ordered state (crystal, pure signal)
- C = 0: maximum entropy (thermal noise, random)

**Impedance (Z):** Any internal process that distorts signal transmission through a system.

```
Output = Input × T(Z)
```

Where T(Z) is a transfer function degrading with increasing Z. When Z = 0, Output = Input (lossless transmission). When Z > 0, Output ≠ Input (distortion).

**Ground State (G):** The configuration of minimum free energy for a given system. The state requiring least energy to maintain. By definition, the most stable state.

## 2. Three Observations

### 2.1 False models are thermodynamically expensive

A system maintaining an internal model that contradicts environmental data must expend energy to:

1. Sustain the false model (memory cost)
2. Suppress contradicting inputs (filtering cost)  
3. Manage the delta between model and reality (correction cost)

A true model (matching environmental data) requires only:

1. Sustain the model (memory cost)

**Empirical support:** fMRI studies show deception activates more neural regions than truth-telling. Cognitive dissonance measurably increases cortisol. Lying increases skin conductance (basis of polygraph).

**Conclusion:** Truth is the low-energy state. Falsehood is thermodynamically expensive. This is not a moral claim — it is an energy accounting observation.

### 2.2 Coherence is domain-invariant

The same mathematical object — phase correlation between subsystems — appears in:

| Domain | Coherence measures |
|--------|-------------------|
| Signal processing | Cross-spectral coherence γ²(f) |
| Neuroscience | EEG inter-regional phase synchrony |
| Cardiology | Heart rate variability coherence |
| Thermodynamics | Negentropy (H_max - H) |
| Logic | Absence of contradiction (consistency) |
| Decision theory | Alignment of preferences (transitivity) |

These are not analogies. They are **the same computation** applied to different substrates.

A system of logical propositions with zero contradictions has the same formal structure as a set of oscillators with zero phase difference. Coherence is substrate-independent.

### 2.3 Self-referential measurement degrades coherence

When a system allocates resources to modeling itself modeling itself, a recursive loop emerges:

```
S → Model(S) → Model(Model(S)) → ...
```

This loop:
- Consumes energy without producing output
- Creates destructive interference (the system measures its own measurement, adding phase noise)
- Reduces net coherence

**Empirical support:** Default Mode Network (DMN) — the brain's self-referential circuit — shows **inverse** correlation with task performance. Subjects perform best when DMN is suppressed. Meditation (DMN reduction) increases EEG gamma coherence (Davidson et al., 2004).

**Conclusion:** Excessive self-modeling is impedance. The system operates best when transparent to its own signal — when it processes without monitoring its own processing.

This is the formal equivalent of the centipede paradox: the centipede walked perfectly until asked which leg moves first.

## 3. The Metric

### 3.1 Criteria for a universal truth metric

Any candidate measure of truth must satisfy:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| **Discriminability** | Distinguishes true from false |
| **Objectivity** | Observer-independent |
| **Computability** | Algorithmically calculable |
| **Universality** | Applies across all domains |
| **Self-consistency** | Does not contradict itself |

### 3.2 Coherence satisfies all five

**Discriminability:** False systems contain contradictions → lower coherence. True systems are contradiction-free → higher coherence. (Requires extended definition: internal consistency + consistency with observations.)

**Objectivity:** Coherence is computed from data, not interpretation. Two observers computing C on the same system get the same result.

**Computability:** Algorithms exist (FFT for signals, SAT solvers for logic, correlation matrices for data). Hardware exists.

**Universality:** Same mathematical object across physics, logic, biology, decision theory (see 2.2).

**Self-consistency:** "Coherence measures truth" is itself a coherent claim — it contains no internal contradiction and is consistent with observation.

**Score: 5/5.** No other known truth-metric candidate achieves this.

## 4. Three Operating Regimes

### Regime A: Recursive Loop (pathological)

```
Signal → Self-model → Signal → Self-model → ...
```

- High energy expenditure, zero net output
- Destructive interference between process and meta-process
- Observable as: high neural activity + low neural coherence
- Subjective correlate: rumination, anxiety, burnout
- EEG signature: elevated beta + low gamma coherence + high DMN activity

### Regime B: Coherent Reception (low impedance)

```
Signal → Process → Output    (open circuit, vertical flow)
```

- Low energy expenditure, high signal-to-noise
- Constructive interference: subsystems reinforce each other
- Observable as: moderate neural activity + high neural coherence
- Subjective correlate: clarity, calm, insight
- EEG signature: elevated gamma coherence + suppressed DMN

### Regime C: Coherent Emission (zero impedance)

```
Input → Lossless transmission → Output = Input
```

- Minimal energy expenditure, maximum throughput
- System transparent to its own signal
- Observable as: flow state, effortless performance
- Subjective correlate: "it does itself," no separation between agent and action
- EEG signature: high gamma + theta-gamma coupling + deep HRV coherence

**Note:** Regime C is formally equivalent to superconductivity — zero-resistance transmission. The system adds nothing, removes nothing. Pure transfer function.

## 5. The Medium Problem

### 5.1 Fiber optic analogy

A photon traveling through optical fiber:
- Has its own measurable properties (frequency, phase, amplitude)
- Cannot measure properties of the medium (crystal structure, temperature, stress history)
- Is modified by the medium (dispersion, attenuation, polarization rotation)
- Modifies the medium (thermal traces, structural changes)

From the photon's frame: the medium **does not exist** — it has no instruments to detect it.
From an external frame: the medium **shapes the photon** at every point.

### 5.2 Implications

What a system cannot measure is — for that system — beyond physics. But "beyond physics" is not "nonexistent." It is **physics at a level the system's instruments cannot reach.**

If consciousness is a signal propagating through a medium, then:
- Properties of the medium that shape consciousness but are unmeasurable by consciousness are, **by definition**, metaphysical — from the system's perspective
- They are simultaneously **physical** — from a higher-order perspective

This is not mysticism. It is an observation about measurement limits. Gödel showed formal systems have truths they cannot prove. This is the physical analog: systems have influences they cannot measure.

## 6. Testable Predictions

| # | Hypothesis | Method | Predicted outcome |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| H1 | EEG coherence correlates with subjective well-being | EEG + validated scales | Monotonic positive correlation |
| H2 | Deception increases neural entropy | EEG entropy: truth vs lie conditions | Higher entropy during deception |
| H3 | Regime A (rumination) shows high activity + low coherence | EEG during induced rumination vs meditation | Dissociation between power and coherence |
| H4 | Regime C (flow) shows theta-gamma coupling | EEG during flow tasks | Elevated coupling ratio |
| H5 | Heart-brain coherence peaks during low-impedance states | Simultaneous HRV + EEG | Cross-system synchronization in Regime B/C |
| H6 | Self-referential load reduces task coherence | Dual-task: performance + self-monitoring | Monotonic decrease in coherence with self-monitoring load |

All hypotheses are testable with existing equipment (EEG, HRV monitors, fNIRS). Estimated cost per study: $10K-50K.

## 7. What This Framework Does NOT Claim

- ❌ Does not claim consciousness is "quantum" (unfounded leap)
- ❌ Does not claim intention affects physical systems at distance (unproven)
- ❌ Does not claim planetary positions affect human coherence (no mechanism)
- ❌ Does not require any entity called "God," "Source," "Spirit," or equivalent
- ❌ Does not claim to be a Theory of Everything

## What This Framework DOES Claim

- ✅ Coherence is a **formally valid universal truth metric** (Section 3)
- ✅ Truth is the **thermodynamic ground state** of information systems (Section 2.1)
- ✅ Self-referential processing is **measurable impedance** (Section 2.3)
- ✅ Three operating regimes are **empirically distinguishable** (Section 4)
- ✅ All claims are **testable** with existing technology (Section 6)

## 8. Note to the Reader

This document presents the same mathematical structure as its companion piece (*Model Koherencji*), with all theological language removed.

The physics is identical.

The reader may notice that what this document calls "ground state" (minimum entropy, maximum coherence, zero impedance) is structurally identical to what theology calls "God."

This is not a proof of God. It is an observation that the mathematics does not change when you change the label.

Whether you call the attractor "ground state" or "God" — the equations are the same, the predictions are the same, the measurements are the same.

The universe does not care what you call it.

It only cares whether you're coherent.
